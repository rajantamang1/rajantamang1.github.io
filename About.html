        <p class="summary" style="text-indent: 2cm;  margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">After transitioning from United states Army, I joined Amazon as Software Development Engineer Apprentic in June 2020. My time in Army was great. I was able to experience different role and learn from remarkable leaders. During my transitioning period I was fortunate to join Micrsoft Software and Systems Academy and acquire skills of cloud computing.Currenlty, I am in the initial step of the apprenticeship program, where I am learning and enhancing my programming skills. Coding, programming or developing applications/software has always been my passion. Due to such passion, I received my undergraduate degree from Louisiana Tech University in Computer Information Systems and join coding bootcamp for Java after the graduation.</p>  
      <p class="summary" style="text-indent: 2cm; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;"> Born and raised in Nepal, I came in United States in 2008 to study. I plan on enhancing my programming skills and leadership skills through the apprenticeship program and eventually work as an permanent employee. I also plan on involing in social work by being a member of Rotary Club International. While working, I look forward to pursue my Master in Business Administration degree and acquire more leadership and entrepreneur skills.
