        During the transition period( 6 months of end of service date from
        Army),I had the opportunity to join Microsoft Software and Systems
        Academy. I learned about the cloud platfrom and different feature, that
        we can do from cloud computing. Some of the projects, I did were
        Connecting the virutal Network in two different network and different
        subscription, Adding Availabilty set even after creating the Virtual
        Machines.

        During the College, few small projects were part of the grade. Some of
        those projects were calculator, blackjack game, and login interface
        connecting to the database. In the bootcamp after the College, it was
        more advanced Java instruction. This involve project such as making an
        car object, and making advanced calculator. During the first six weeks
        training provided by TLG, initially there was a code review of creating
        an object with multiple classes that worked as the characteristics of
        the Object class. At the final week, our team worked in unique word
        guessing game which was console based. It was quite amazing experience
        to work with other team members.

        The world is getting easier place is live due to innovations every day.
        Specially, the technology and information technology has made the life
        easier. Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence is advancing every
        day, providing new inventions. Building device or technology which can
        interact with human and fulfill human needs are some of my goal.
        Eventually after few years of experience, I would like to step in that
        side of technology and use my ideas to create new technologies.
